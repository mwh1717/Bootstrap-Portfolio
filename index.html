        <p>Hello! My name is Michael and I am a former Law Enforcement Officer who decided that sitting at a desk,
            for hours a day, would be far healthier than the risks associated with policing the streets of
            Charlotte. I recieved my undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in
            Sociology with a concentration in Criminology. Very quickly after beginning my career with the Federal
            Government, I realized my interest in technology. That realization began me down the path toward my
            graduate degree in Cybersecurity. While I enjoyed the cyber program, it left very little in the way of
            creativity. The need to create a product and further my skills in the technology field led me to the
            Full Stack Web Development program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In the program I
            was able to hone my skills in both front and back end development and am ready to take on the
            challenges of the work force. If you are looking for an individual who can work in a team setting and
            with the urgency of emergency, look no further. I've been in that setting my entire professional
            career!</p>
